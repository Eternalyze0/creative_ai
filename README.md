# Creative AI

A back and forth between a generator LLM and a discriminator LLM to yield long, productive thought processes.

The LLM generator might generate a proof to an IMO math problem in 5 seconds.

The LLM discriminator sees the proof and has to judge whether it is correct or incorrect (fortunately such data exists from humans).

The LLM discriminator makes a judgement call: fake. And provides feedback on why such is the case.

The LLM generator then reads this critique and generates a new proof based on it for the LLM discriminator to evaluate.

This loop of generation and critique creates hours long, productive thought processes, potentially allowing AI to be truly creative in any problem-solving domain (ie what is needed for progress on science, for example).
